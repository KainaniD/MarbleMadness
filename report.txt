Player Avatar & Goodie Control Flow

I utilized the starter code that was given to us as a reference.

The colocation of the player and a goodie was checked using a helper function in the student world class.

If the goodie finds that the student world class's function to check if a colocated player is on that goodie returns true, then:
	- a sound is played from the game world function
	- the score is increased based on a private member variable in the PickupableItem class
	- the goodie's action is performed based on a private virtual function which is further defined in the types of goodies 
	- the goodie is set as dead
